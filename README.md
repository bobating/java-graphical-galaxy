## What it does
The program generates a canvas and draws a number of stars on it, with the option to randomize the number of stars. It also generates a set of lines that connect a set of endpoints, with the option to randomize the number of endpoints. The lines are animated using a timeline animation that increases the width of the lines over time. The program also includes an animation of a single star moving across the canvas with randomly generated colors. The user can interact with the program by clicking on buttons to randomize the stars and lines.
